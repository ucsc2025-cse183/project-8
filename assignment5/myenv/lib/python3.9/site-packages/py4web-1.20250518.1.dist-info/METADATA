        ========
        
        The py4web code is developed by Massimo Di Pierro and other contributors in their own free time. They collectively agree to release the code under the BSD license show below. Whoever contributes code to py4web implicitly agrees to the BSD license. When developers contribute a significant part of code that has applications independent of py4web they are also free to release such code separately under different additional licenses, as long as this does not conflict with the BSD license. If code is copied from a third party source, it is the responsibility of the developer to make sure that it is compatible with the BSD license and to include the proper attribution. If code is developed under a sponsorship agreement or other paid agreement with a third party, this must also be disclosed in a comment within the code. The py4web trademarks are not released under the BSD license but are regulated by the "py4web trademark policy" also shown below.

PY4WEB is a web framework for the rapid development of efficient database driven web applications. It is an evolution of the popular web2py framework but much faster and slicker.

Installation
############

PY4WEB runs fine on Windows, MacOS and Linux. There are many installation procedures `(see the official documentation for details) <https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-03.html>`__ but only two of them are summarized here.

The **simplest way** to install py4web is using binaries, but it's only available for Windows and MacOS. It's meant especially for newbies or students, because it does not require Python pre-installed on your system nor administrative rights. You just need to download the latest Windows or MacOS ZIP file from `this external repository <https://github.com/nicozanf/py4web-pyinstaller>`__. Unzip it on a local folder and open a command line there. Finally run the commands (omit './' if you're using Windows)


.. code:: bash

   ./py4web set_password
   ./py4web run apps




The **standard installation procedure** for py4web on Windows, MacOS and Linux  is using pip. Its only prerequisite is Python 3.7+.

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m pip install --upgrade py4web --no-cache-dir --user


but do **not** type the ''--user'' option with virtualenv or a standard Windows installation which is already per-user.
Also, if ''python3'' does not work, try with the simple ''python'' command instead.


This will install the latest stable release of py4web and all its dependencies on the system's path only. After the installation you'll be able to start py4web on any given working folder with

.. code:: bash

   py4web setup apps
   py4web set_password
   py4web run apps

Example:


.. code:: bash

   py4web run -H 127.0.0.1 -P 8000 -d demo apps


Note that since the default (as specified above) for the host and port are 127.0.0.1 and 8000 respectively, the above command can be shortened to:

.. code:: bash

   py4web run -d demo apps



Tell me more
############

- it is 10-20x faster than web2py
- python3.7+ only
- uses https://github.com/web2py/pydal (same DAL as web2py) for database connection
- uses the same validators as web2py (they are in pyDAL)
- uses `yatl <https://pypi.org/project/yatl/>`__ (same as web2py but defaults to [[...]] instead of {{...}} delimiters) and `Renoir <https://pypi.org/project/renoir/>`__ for html templates
- uses the very similar html helpers to web2py (A, DIV, SPAN, etc.)
- uses https://github.com/web2py/pluralize for i18n and pluralization
- request, response, abort are from https://bottlepy.org, using `ombott (One More BOTTle) <https://github.com/valq7711/ombott>`__,
  which is a fast bottlepy spin-off
- HTTP and redirect are our own objects
- like web2py, it supports static asset management /{appname}/static/_0.0.0/{path}
- implements sessions in cookies (jwt encrypted), db, memcache, redis and custom
- implements a cache.memoize (Ram cache with O(1) access) `Memoize <https://dbader.org/blog/python-memoization>`__
- supports multiple apps under apps folder (same as web2py)
- unlike web2py does not use a custom importer or eval (this allow simple debugging with standard IDE)
- admin has been replaced by a _dashboard
- appadmin has been replaced by dbadmin (within _dashboard)
- auth logic is implemented via a "auth" vue.js custom component
- it comes with a Form object (like SQLFORM on web2py)
- it comes with a Grid object providing grid and CRUD capabilities
- it supports `htmx <https://htmx.org/>`__


- this is a work in progress and not stable yet but close to being stable
- there are not enough tests

Special thanks to Sam de Alfaro, that designed the official logo of py4web. We friendly call the logo "Axel the axolotl": it magically represents the sense of kindness
and inclusion we believe it's the cornerstone of our growing community.
